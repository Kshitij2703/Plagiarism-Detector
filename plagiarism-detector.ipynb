Whose?'\n\n'Well,' he said, without looking at her, 'I fancy there are still some of the Blakes, (the\nword came out with a certain effort) 'living at Bilton, and perhaps you could find out from\nthem the address I want; or, perhaps,' he added quickly, for she understood now, and eager\nwords were on her lips, 'perhaps you know.\n\nHe had not slept very much during the night, for his mind had been too full of the change that\nwas coming in his life, and of the difference that the presence of Edith and little Zoe would\nmake in the dull, old house. Sad and worn and altered, was she! Ah! that would soon pass\naway with kindness and care and happiness, and the cough that had sounded so hollow and ominous\nshould be nursed away, and Edith should be a girl again, a girl as she ought to be yet by right\nof her years; and those five years of suffering and estrangement should be altogether forgotten\nas if they had never been.\n\nHe went into the bedroom next his, that had been Edith's--that was to be Edith's again--and,\nlooking round it, noticed with satisfaction that Jane had kept it just as it had been in the\nold days; and he pushed the bed a little to one side to make room for a cot to stand beside\nit, a cot which he remembered in the night as having stood for years in the lumber-room up\nin the roof, and which he now with much difficulty dragged out from behind some heavy boxes,\nand fitted together, wishing there had been time to give it a coat of paint, and yet glad,\nwith a tremulous sort of gladness, that there was not, seeing that it would be wanted that\nvery night.\n\nAnd just then Jane Sands came up to call him to breakfast, and stood looking from the cot to\nher master's dusty coat, with such a look of delighted comprehension on her face, that the\norganist felt that no words were needed to prepare her for what was going to happen.\n\n'I thought,' he said, 'it had better be brought down.'\n\n'Where shall it go?' she asked.\n\n'In Miss----in the room next mine,' he said, 'and it will want a good airing.'\n\n'Shall I make up the bed too?' she asked.\n\n'Yes, you may as well.'\n\n'Oh, master,' she said, the tears shaking in her voice and shining in her eyes; 'will they\nbe wanted soon? Will they, maybe, be wanted to-night?'\n\nHis own voice felt suspiciously shaky; his own eyes could not see the old cot, nor Jane's beaming\nface quite plainly, so he only gave a gruff assent and turned away.\n\n'What a good, kind creature she is!' he thought. 'What a welcome she will give Edith and Edith's\nlittle Zoe!'\n\nDuring the morning he heard her up in the room sweeping and scrubbing, as if for these five\nyears it had been left a prey to dust and dirt; and when he went out after dinner to give a\nlesson at Bilton, she was still at it with an energy worthy of a woman, half her age.\n\nThat stupid little girl at Bilton, who generally found her music-lesson such an intolerable\nweariness to the flesh, and was conscious that it was no less so to her teacher, found the\nhalf-hour to-day quite pleasant. Mr Robins had never been so kind and cheerful, quite amusing,\nlaughing at her mistakes, and allowing her to play just the things she knew best, and to get\nup in the middle of the lesson to go to the window and see a long procession of gypsy vans\ngoing by to Smithurst fair.\n\nIt was such a very beautiful day; perhaps it was this that produced such a good effect on the\norganist's temper. There had been a frost that morning, but it was not enough to strip the\ntrees, but only to turn the elms a richer gold, and the beeches a warmer red, and the oaks\na ruddier brown; while in the hedges the purple dogwood, and hawthorn, and bramble leaves made\na wonderful variety of rich tints in the full bright sunshine, which set the birds twittering\nwith a momentary delusion that it might be spring.\n\"\"\"\n\nresult = detect_plagiarism(input_text)\nprint(f'Text: \"{input_text[:50]}...\" - Result: {result}') \n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-29T09:21:46.347130Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-29T09:21:46.347875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-29T09:21:46.392964Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-29T09:21:46.347832Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-29T09:21:46.391964Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Text: \"\n'An address?

Here,\nyou were confined to a quagmire by impervious underwood of prickly pear, penguin, and speargrass;\nand when we rode under the drooping branches of the trees, that the leaves might brush away\nthe halo of musquittoes, flying ants, and other winged plagues that buzzed about our temples,\nwe found, to our dismay, that we had made bad worse by the introduction of a whole colony of\ngarapatos, or wood--ticks, into our eyebrows and hair.  At length, for the second time, so\nfar as I was concerned, we reached the reached the headquarters at Torrecilla, and were well\nreceived by the Spanish commander--in--chief, a tall, good--looking, soldierlike man, whose\npersonal qualities had an excellent foil in the captain--general of the province, an old friend\nof mine, as already mentioned, and who certainly looked full as like a dancing--master, or,\nat the best, perruquier en general to the staff, as a viceroy.\n\nGeneral Morillo, however, had a great share of Sancho Panza shrewdness, and I will add kindness,\nabout him.  We were drenched and miserable when we arrived, yet he might have turned us over,\nnaturally enough, to the care of his staff.  No such thing; the first thing he did was to walk\nboth of us behind a canvass screen, that shut off one end of the large barnlike room, where\na long table was laid for dinner.  This was his sleeping apartment, and drawing out of a leather\nbag two suits of uniform, he rigged us almost with his own hands.  Presently a point of war\nwas sounded by half--a--dozen trumpeters, and Splinter and I made our appearance each in the\ndress of a Spanish general.  The party consisted of Morillo's personal staff, the captain--general,\nthe inquisidor general, and several colonels and majors of different regiments.  In all, twenty\npeople sat down to dinner; among whom were several young Spanish noblemen, some of whom I had\nmet on my former visit, who, having served in the Peninsular war under the great Duke, made\ntheir advances with great cordiality. Strange enough--Splinter and I were the only parties\npresent in uniform; all the others, priests and soldiers, were clothed in gingham coats and\nwhite trowsers.\n\nThe besieging force at this time was composed of about five thousand Spaniards, as fine troops\nas I ever saw, and three thousand Creoles under the command of that desperate fellow Morales.\nI was not long in recognising an old friend of mine in the person of Captain Bayer, an aide--de--camp\nof Morillo, amongst the company.  He was very kind and attentive, and rather startled me by\nspeaking very tolerable English now, from a kindly motive I make no question, whereas, when\nI had known him before in Kingston, he professed to speak nothing but Spanish or French. He\nwas a German by birth, and lived to rise to the rank of colonel in the Spanish army, where\nhe subsequently greatly distinguished himself, but he at length fell in some obscure skirmish\nin New Granada; and my old ally Morillo, Count of Carthagena, is now living in penury, an exile\nin Paris.\n\nAfter being, as related, furnished with food and raiment, we retired to our quatres, a most\nprimitive sort of couch, being a simple wooden frame, with a piece of canvass stretched over\nit.  However, if we had no mattresses, we had none of the disagreeables often incidental to\nthem, and, fatigue proved a good opiate, for we slept soundly until the drums and trumpets\nof the troops, getting under arms, awoke us at daylight.  The army was under weigh to occupy\nCarthagena, which had fallen through famine, and we had no choice but to accompany it.\n\nI knew nothing of the misery of a siege but by description; the reality even to me, case--hardened\nas I was by my own recent sufferings, was dreadful.  We entered by the gate of the raval, or\nsuburb.  There was not a living thing to be seen in the street; the houses had been pulled\ndown, that the fire of the place might not be obstructed in the event of a lodgment in the\noutwork.  We passed on, the military music echoing mournfully amongst the ruined walls, to\nthe main gate, or Puerto de Tiera, which was also open, and the drawbridge lowered.  Under\nthe archway, we saw a delicate female, worn to the bone, and weak as an infant, gathering garbage\nof the most loathsome description, the possession of which had been successfully disputed by\na carrion crow.  A little farther on, the bodies of an old man and two small children were\nputrefying in the sun, while beside them lay a misererable, wasted, dying negro, vainly endeavouring\nto keep at a distance with a palm branch a number of the same obscene birds that were already\ndevouring the carcass of one of the infants; before two hours, the faithful servant, and those\nhe attempted to defend, were equally the prey of the disgusting gallinaso.  The houses, as\nwe proceeded, appeared entirely deserted, except where a solitary spectre like inhabitant appeared\nat a balcony, and feebly exclaimed, \"Viva, los Espanoles!  Viva, Fernando Septimo!\"--We saw\nno domestic animal whatsoever, not even a cat or a dog; but I will not dwell on these horrible\ndetails any longer.\n\nOne morning, shortly after our arrival, as we strolled beyond the land gate, we came to a place\nwhere four banquillos (a sort of short bench or stool, with an upright post at one end firmly\nfixed into the ground) were placed opposite a dead wall.  They were painted black, and we were\nnot left long in suspense as to their use; for solemn music, and the roll of muffled drums\nin the distance, were fearful indications of what we were to witness.\n\nFirst came an entire regiment of Spanish infantry, which, filing off, formed three sides of\na square,--the wall near which the banquillos were placed forming the fourth; then eight priests,\nand as many choristers chanting the service for the dying; next came several mounted officers\nof the staff, and four firing parties of twelve men each.  Three Spanish American prisoners\nfollowed, dressed in white, with crucifixes in their hands, each supported, more dead than\nalive, by two priests; but when the fourth victim appeared, we could neither look at nor think\nof any thing else.\n\nOn enquiry we found he was an Englishman, of the name of S----: English, that is, in all except\nthe place of his birth, for his whole education had been English, as were his parents and all\nhis family; but it came out, accidentally I believe, on his trial, that he had been born at\nBuenos Ayres, and having joined the patriots, this brought treason home to him, which he was\nnow led forth to expiate.  Whilst his fellow--sufferers appeared crushed down to the very earth,\nunder their intense agony, so that they had to be supported as they tottered towards the place\nof execution, he stepped firmly and manfully out, and seemed impatient when at any time, from\nthe crowding in front, the procession was obliged to halt.  At length they reached the fatal\nspot, and his three companions in misery being placed astride on the banquillos, their arms\ntwisted round the upright posts, and fastened to them with cords, their backs being towards\nthe soldiers.  Mr S----walked firmly up to the vacant bench, knelt down, and covering his face\nwith his hands, rested his head on the edge of it.  For a brief space he seemed to be engaged\nin prayer, during which he sobbed audibly, but soon recovering himself, he rose, and folding\nhis arms across his breast, sat down slowly and deliberately on the banquillo, facing the firing\nparty with an unshrinking eye.\n\nHe was now told that he must turn his back and submit to be tied like the others.  He resisted\nthis, but on force being attempted to be used, he sprung to his feet, and stretching out his\nhand, while a dark red flush passed transiently across his pale face, he exclaimed in a loud\nvoice, \"Thus, thus, and not otherwise, you may butcher me, but I am an Englishman and no traitor,\nnor will I die the death of one.\" Moved by his gallantry, the soldiers withdrew, and left him\nstanding.  At this time the sun was intensely hot, it was high noon, and the monk who attended\nMr S----held an umbrella over his head; but the preparations being completed, he kissed him\non both cheeks, while the hot tears trickled down his own, and was stepping back, when the\nunhappy man said to him, with the most perfect composure, \"Todavia padre, todavia, mucho me\ngusta la sombra.\" But the time had arrived, the kind--hearted monk was obliged to retire. \nThe signal was given, the musketry rattled, and they were as clods of the valley \"Truly,\" quoth\nold Splinter, \"a man does sometimes become a horse by being born in a stable.\"\n\nSome time after this we were allowed to go to the village of Turbaco, a few miles distant from\nthe city, for change of air.  On the third morning after our arrival, about the dawning, I\nwas suddenly awakened by a shower of dust on my face, and a violent shaking of the bed, accompanied\nby a low grumbling unearthly noise, which seemed to pass immediately under where I lay.  Were\nI to liken it to any thing I had ever experienced before, it would be to the lumbering and\ntremor of a large waggon in a tempestuous night, heard and felt through the thin walls of a\nLondon house.--Like--yet how fearfully different!\n\nIn a few seconds the motion ceased, and the noise gradually died away in hollow echoes in the\ndistance--whereupon ensued such a crowing of cocks, cackling of geese, barking of dogs, lowing\nof kine, neighing of horses, and shouting of men, women, and children amongst the negro and\ncoloured domestics, as baffles all description, whilst the various white inmates of the house\n(the rooms, for air and coolness, being without ceiling, and simply divided by partitions run\nup about ten feet high) were, one and all, calling to their servants and each other, in accents\nwhich did not by any means evince great composure.  In a moment this hubbub again sank into\nthe deepest silence--man, and the beasts of the field, and the fowls of the air, became mute\nwith breathless awe, at the impending tremendous manifestation of the power of that Almighty\nBeing in whose hands the hills are as a very little thing--for the appalling voice of the earthquake\nwas once more heard growling afar off, like distant thunder mingling with the rushing of a\nmighty wind, waxing louder and louder as it approached, and upheaving the sure and firm--set\nearth into long undulations, as if its surface had been the rolling swell of the fathomless\nocean.  The house rocked, pictures of saints fell from the walls, tables and chairs were overturned,\nthe window frames were forced out of their embrasures and broken in pieces, beams and rafters\ngroaned and screamed, crushing the tiles of the roof into ten thousand fragments.  In several\nplaces the ground split open into chasms a fathom wide, with an explosion like a cannon--shot;\nthe very foundation of the house seemed to be sinking under us; and whilst men and women rushed\nlike maniacs naked into the fields, with a yell as if the Day of Judgment had arrived, and\nthe whole brute creation, in an agony of fear, made the most desperate attempts to break forth\nfrom their enclosures into the open air, the end wall of my apartment was shaken down; and\nfalling outwards with a deafening crash, disclosed, in the dull grey mysterious twilight of\nmorning, the huge gnarled trees that overshadowed the building, bending and groaning, amidst\nclouds of dust, as if they had been tormented by a tempest, although the air was calm and motionless\nas death.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe Piccaroon\n\n\"Ours the wild life in tumult still to range.\"\n\nBYRON, THE CORSAIR, I. 7.\n\nSome time after this, we once more returned to Carthagena, to be at hand should any opportunity\noccur for Jamaica, and A.--Jwere lounging about one forenoon on the fortifications, looking\nwith sickening hearts out to seaward, when a voice struck up the following negro ditty close to us:\n\n\"Fader was a Corramantee, Moder was a Mingo, Black picaniny buccra wantee, So dem sell a me\nPeter, by jingo, Jiggery, jiggery, jiggery.\"\n\n\"Well sung, Massa Bungo,\" exclaimed Mr Splinter; \"where do you hail from, my hearty?\"\n\n\"Hiflo!  Bungo, indeed! free and easy dat, anyhow.  Who you yousef, eh?\"\n\n\"Why, Peter,\" continued the Lieutenant, \"don't you know me?\" \"Cannot say dat I do,\" rejoined\nthe negro, very gravely, without lifting his head, as he sat mending his jacket in one of the\nembrasures near the water gate of the arsenal--\"Have not de honour of your acquaintance, sir.\"\n\nHe then resumed his scream, for song it could not be called:--\n\n\"Mammy Sally's daughter, Lose him shoe in an old canoe, Dat lay halffull of water, And den\nshe knew not what to do. Jiggery, jig\"--\n\n\"Confound your jiggery, jiggery, sir!  But I know you well enough, my man; and you can scarcely\nhave forgotten Lieutenant Splinter of the Torch, one would think?\"\n\nHowever, it was clear that the poor fellow really had not known us; for the name so startled\nhim, that, in his hurry to unlace his legs from under him, as he sat tailor--fashion, he fairly\ncapsized out of his perch, and toppled down on his nose--a feature fortunately so flattened\nby the hand of nature, that I question if it could have been rendered more obtuse had he fallen\nout of the maintop on a timber--head, or a marine officer's.\n\n\"Eh!--no--yes, him sure enough; and who is de picaniny hofficer--Oh! I see, Massa Tom Cringle?\nGaramighty, gentlemen, where have you drop from?--Where is de old Torch?  Many a time hab I\nPeter Mangrove, pilot to Him Britanic Magesty squadron, taken de old brig in and through amongst\nde keys at Port Royal!\"\n\n\"Ay, and how often did you scour her copper against the coral reefs, Peter?\"\n\nHis Majesty's pilot gave a knowing look, and laid his hand on his breast \"No more of dat if\nyou love me, massa.\"\n\n\"Well, well, it don't signify now, my boy; she will never give you that trouble again--foundered--all\nhands lost, Peter, but the two you see before you.\"\n\n\"Werry sorry, Massa Plinter, werry sorry--What! de black cooksmate and all?--But misfortune\ncan't be help.  Stop till I put up my needle, and I will take a turn wid you.\" Here he drew\nhimself up with a great deal of absurd gravity.  \"Proper dat British hofficer in distress should\nassist one anoder--We shall consult togeder.--How can I serve you?\"\n\n\"Why, Peter, if you could help us to a passage to Port Royal, it would be serving us most essentially.\nWhen we used to be lying there, a week seldom passed without one of the squadron arriving from\nthis; but here have we been for more than a month, without a single pennant belonging to the\nstation having looked in: our money is running short, and if we are to hold on in Carthagena\nfor another six weeks, we shall not have a shot left in the locker--not a copper to tinkle\non a tombstone.\"\n\nThe negro looked steadfastly at us, then carefully around.  There was no one near.\n\n\"You see, Massa Plinter, I am desirable to serve you, for one little reason of my own; but,\nbeside dat, it is good for me at present to make some friend wid de hofficer of de squadron,\nbeing as how dat I am absent widout leave.\"\n\n\"Oh, I perceive--a large R against your name in the master attendant's books, eh?\"\n\n\"You have hit it, sir, werry close; besides I long mosh to return to my poor wife, Nancy Cator,\ndat I leave, wagabone dat I is, just about to be confine.\"\n\nI could not resist putting in my oar.\n\n\"I saw Nancy just before we sailed, Peter,--fine child that; not quite so black as you, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, massa,\" said Snowball, grinning and showing his white teeth, \"you know I am soch a terrible\nblack fellow--But you are a leetle out at present, massa--I meant, about to be confine in de\nworkhouse, for stealing de admiral's Muscovy ducks;\" and he laughed loud and long.--\"However,\nif you will promise dat you will stand my friends, I will put you in de way of getting a shove\nacross to de east end of Jamaica; and I will go wid you, too, for company.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" rejoined Mr Splinter; \"but how do you mean to manage this? There is no Kingston\ntrader here at present, and you don't mean to make a start of it in an open boat, do you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I don't; but in de first place--as you are a gentleman, will you try and get me off\nwhen we get to Jamaica?  Secondly, wi you promise dat you will not seek to know more of de\nvessel you may go in, nor of her crew, than dey are willing to tell you, provided you are landed\nsafe?\"\n\n\"Why, Peter, I scarcely think you would deceive us, for you know I saved your bacon in that\nawkward affair, when through drunkenness you plumped the Torch ashore, so\"--\n\n\"Forget dat, sir,----forget dat!--Never shall poor black pilot forget how you saved him from\nbeing seized upt when de gratings, boatswain's mates, and all, were ready at de gangway@never\nshall poor black rascal forget dat.\"\n\n\"Indeed I do not think you would wittingly betray us into trouble, Peter; and as I guess you\nmean one of the forced traders, we will venture in her, rather than kick about here any longer,\nand pay a moderate sum for our passage.\"\n\n\"Den wait here five minute,\"--and so saying he slipt down through the embrasure into a canoe\nthat lay beneath, and in a trice we saw him jump on board of a long low nondescript kind of\ncraft, that lay moored within pistol--shot of the walls.\n\nShe was a large shallow vessel, coppered to the bends, of great breadth of beam, with bright\nsides, like an American, so painted as to give her a clumsy mercantile sheer externally, but\nthere were many things that belied this to a nautical eye: her copper, for instance, was bright\nas burnished gold on her very sharp bows and beautiful run; and we could see from the bastion\nwhere we stood, that her decks were flush and level.  She had no cannon mounted that were visible,\nbut we distinguished grooves on her well--scrubbed decks, as from the recent traversing of\ncarronade slides, while the bolts and rings in her high and solid bulwarks shone clear and\nbright in the ardent noontide.  There was a tarpawling stretched over a quantity of rubbish,\nold sails, old junk, and hencoops rather ostentatiously piled up forward, which we conjectured\nmight conceal a long gun.\n\nShe was a very taught--rigged hermaphrodite, or brig forward and schooner aft.  Her foremast\nand bowsprit were immensely strong and heavy, and her mainmast was so long and tapering, that\nthe wonder was, how the few shrouds and stays about it could support it: it was the handsomest\nstick we had ever seen.  Her upper spars were on the same scale, tapering away through topmast,\ntopgallant--mast, royal and skysail--masts, until they fined away into slender wands.  The\nsails, that were loose to dry, were old, and patched, And evidently displayed to cloak the\ncharacter of the vessel, by an ostentatious show of their unserviceable condition, but her\nrigging was beautifully fitted, every rope lying in the chafe of another being carefully served\nwith hide.  There were several large bushy--whiskered fellows lounging about the deck, with\ntheir hair gathered into dirty net bags, like the fishermen of Barcelona; many had red silk\nsashes round their waists, through which were stuck their long knives, in shark--skin sheaths.\nTheir numbers were not so great as to excite suspicion; but a certain daring reckless manner,\nwould at once have distinguished them, independently of any thing else, from the quiet, hard--worked,\nredshirted merchant seaman.\n\n\"That chap is not much to be trusted,\" said the Lieutenant; \"his bunting would make a few jackets\nfor Joseph, I take it.\" But we had little time to be critical before our friend Peter came\npaddling back with another blackamoor in the stem, of as ungainly an exterior as could well\nbe, imagined.  He was a very large man, whose weight every now and then, as they breasted the\nshort sea, cocked up the snout of the canoe with Peter Mangrove in it, as if he had been a\ncork, leaving him to flourish his paddle in the air, like the weatherwheel of a steam--boat\nin a sea--way. The new comer was strong and broad--shouldered, with long muscular arms, and\na chest like Hercules; but his legs and thighs were, for his bulk, remarkably puny and misshapen.\nA thick fell of black wool, in close tufts, as if his face had been stuck full of cloves, covered\nhis chin and upper lip; and his hair, if hair it could be called, was twisted into a hundred\nshort plaits, that bristled out, and gave his head, when he took his hat off, the appearance\nof a porcupine.  There was a large sabre--cut across his nose, and down his cheek, and he wore\ntwo immense gold earrmgs. His dress consisted of short cotton drawers, that did not reach within\ntwo inches of his knee, leaving his thin cucumber shanks (on which the small bullet--like calf\nappeared to have been stuck before, through mistake, in place of abaft) naked to the shoe;\na check shirt, and an enormously large Panama hat, made of a sort of cane, split small, and\nworn shovel--fashion. Notwithstanding, he made his bow by no means ungracefully, and offered\nhis services in choice Spanish, but spoke English as soon as he heard who we were.\n\n\"Pray, sir, are you the master of that vessel?\" said the lieutenant.\n\n\"No, sir, I am the mate, and I learn you are desirous of a passage to Jamaica.\" This was spoken\nwith a broad Scotch accent.\n\n\"Yes, we are,\" said I, in very great astonishment; \"but we will not sail with the devil; and\nwho ever saw a negro Scotchman before, the spirit of Nicol Jarvie conjured into a blackamoor's\nskin!\"\n\nThe fellow laughed.  \"I am black, as you see; so were my father and mother before me.\" And\nhe looked at me, as much as to say, I have read the book you quote from.  \"But I was born in\nthe good town of Port--Glasgow, notwithstanding, and many a voyage I have made as cabin--boy\nand cook, in the good ship the Peggy Bogle, with worthy old jock Hunter; but that matters not.\nI was told you wanted to go to Jamaica; I dare say our captain will take you for a moderate\npassagemoney.  But here he comes to speak for himself.--Captain Vanderbosh, here are two shipwrecked\nBritish officers, who wish to be put on shore on the east end of Jamaica; will you take them,\nand what will you charge for their passage?\"\n\nThe man he spoke to was nearly as tall as himself; he was a sunburnt, angular, raw--boned,\niron--visaged veteran, with a nose in shape and colour like the bowl of his own pipe, but not\nat all, according to the received idea, like a Dutchman.  His dress was quizzical enoughwhite\ntrowsers, a long--flapped embroidered waistcoat, that might have belonged to a Spanish grandee,\nwith an old--fashioned French--cut coat, showing the frayed marks where the lace had been stripped\noff, voluminous in the skirts, but very tight in the sleeves, which were so short as to leave\nhis large bony paws, and six inches of his arm above the wrist, exposed; altogether, it fitted\nhim like a purser's shirt on a handspike.\n\n\"Vy, for von hondred thaler, I will land dem safe in Mancheoneal Bay; but how shall ve manage,\nVilliamson?  De cabin vas point yesterday.\"\n\nThe Scotch negro nodded.  \"Never mind; I dare say the smell of the paint won't signify to the\ngentlemen.\"\n\nThe bargain was ratified, we agreed to pay the stipulated sum, and that same evening, having\ndropped down with the last of the seabreeze, we set sail from Bocca Chica, and began working\nup under the lee of the headland of Punto Canoa.  When off the San Domingo Gate, we burned\na blue light, which was immediately answered by another in shore of us.  In the glare, we could\nperceive two boats, full of men.  Any one who has ever played at snapdragon, can imagine the\nunearthly appearance of objects when seen by this species of firework.  In the present instance,\nit was held aloft on a boat--hook, and cast a strong spectral light on the band of lawless\nruffians, who were so crowded together, that they entirely filled the boats, no part of which\ncould be seen.  It seemed as if two clusters of fiends, suddenly vomited forth from hell, were\nfloating on the surface of the midnight sea, in the midst of brimstone flames.  In a few moments,\nour crew was strengthened by about forty as ugly Christians as I ever set eyes on. They were\nof all ages, countries, complexions, and tongues, and looked as if they had been kidnapped\nby a pressgang, as they had knocked off from the Tower of Babel.  From the moment they came\non board, Captain Vanderbosh was shorn of all his glory, and sank into the petty officer, while,\nto our amazement, the Scottish negro took the command, evincing great coolness, energy, and\nskill.  He ordered the schooner to be wore, as soon as we had shipped the men, and laid her\nhead off the land, then set all hands to shift the old suit of sails, and to bend new ones.\n\n\"Why did you not shift your canvass before we started?\" said I to the Dutch captain, or mate,\nor whatever he might be.\n\n\"Vy vont you be content to take a quiet passage and hax no question?\" was the uncivil rejoinder,\nwhich I felt inclined to resent, until I remembered that we were in the hands of the Philistines,\nwhere a quarrel would have been worse than useless. I was gulping down the insult as well as\nI could, when the black captain came--aft, and, with the air of an equal, invited us into the\ncabin to take a glass of grog.  We had scarcely sat down before we heard a noise like the swaying\nup of guns, or some other heavy articles, from the hold.\n\nI caught Mr Splinter's eye--he nodded, but said nothing.  In half an hour afterwards, when\nwe went on deck, we saw by the light of the moon, twelve eighteen--pound carronades mounted,\nsix of a side, with their accompaniments of rammers and sponges, water buckets, boxes of round,\ngrape, and canister, and tubs of wadding, while the combings of the hatchways were thickly\nstudded with round shot.  The tarpawling and lumber forward had disappeared, and there lay\nlong Tom ready levelled, grinning on his pivot.\n\nThe ropes were all coiled away, and laid down in regular man--of--war fashion; while an ugly\ngruff beast of a Spanish mulatto, apparently the officer of the watch, walked the weather--side\nof the quarter--deck, in the true pendulum style.  Look--outs were placed aft, and at the gangways\nand bows, who every now and then passed the word to keep a bright look--out, while the rest\nof the watch were stretched silent, but evidently broad awake, under the lee of the boat. \nWe noticed that each man had his cutlass buckled round his waistthat the boarding--pikes had\nbeen cut loose from the main boom, round which they had been stopped, and that about thirty\nmuskets were ranged along a fixed'rack, that ran athwart ships, near the main hatchway.\n\nBy the time we had reconnoitred thus far, the night became overcast, and a thick bank of clouds\nbegan to rise to windward; some heavy drops of rain fell, and the thunder grumbled at a distance.\nThe black veil crept gradually on, until it shrouded the whole firmament, and left us in as\ndark a night as ever poor devils were out in.  By and by, a narrow streak of bright moonlight\nappeared under the lower edge of the bank, defining the dark outlines of the tumbling multitudinous\nbillows on the horizon, as distinctly as if they had been pasteboard waves in a theatre.\n\n\"Is that a sail to windward, in the clear, think you?\" said Mr Splinter to me in a whisper.\nAt this moment it lightened vividly.  \"I am sure it is,\" continued he--\"I could see her white\ncanvass glance just now.\"\n\nI looked steadily, and, at last, caught the small dark speck against the bright background,\nrising and falling on the swell of the sea like a feather,\n\nAs we stood on, she was seen more distinctly, but, to all appearance, nobody was aware of her\nproximity.  We were mistaken in this, however, for the captain suddenly jumped on a gun, and\ngave his orders with a fiery energy that startled us.\n\n\"Leroux!\" A small French boy was at his side in a moment.  \"Forward, and call all hands to\nshorten sail; but, doucement, you land crab!--Man the fore clew--garnets.--Hands by the topgallant\nclewlines--peak and throat haulyards--jib down--haul--rise tacks and sheets--let go--clew up--settle\naway the main--gaff there!\"\n\nIn almost as short a space as I have taken to write it, every inch of canvass was close furled--every\nlight, except the one in the binnacle, and that was cautiously masked, carefully extinguished--a\nhundred and twenty men at quarters, and the ship under bare poles.  The head yards were then\nsquared, and we bore up before the wind.  The stratagem proved successful; the strange sail\ncould be seen through the night glasses, cracking on close to the wind, evidently under the\nimpression that we had tacked.\n\n\"Dere she goes, chasing de Gobel,\" said the Dutchman.\n\nShe now burned a blue light, by which we saw she was a heavy cutter without doubt our old fellow--cruiser\nthe Spark.  The Dutchman had come to the same conclusion.\n\n\"My eye, Captain, no use to dodge from her; it is only dat footy little King's cutter on de\nJamaica station.\"\n\n\"It is her, true enough,\" answered Williamson; \"and she is from Santa Martha with a freight\nof specie, I know. I will try a brush with her by\"\n\nSplinter struck in before he could finish his irreverent exclamation.  \"If your conjecture\nbe true, I know the craft--a heavy vessel of her class, and you may depend on hard knocks,\nand small profit if you do take her; while, if she takes you\"--\n\n\"I'll be hanged if she does\"--and he grinned at the conceit--then setting his teeth hard, \"or\nrather, I will blow the schooner up with my own hand before I strike; better that than have\none's bones bleached in chains on a key at Port Royal.--But, you see you cannot control us,\ngentlemen; so get down into the cable tier and take Peter Mangrove with you. I would not willingly\nsee those come to harm who have trusted me.\"\n\nHowever, there was no shot flying as yet, we therefore staid on deck.  All sail was once more\nmade; the carronades were cast loose on both sides, and double--shotted; the long gun slewed\nround; the tack of the fore--and--aft foresail hauled up, and we kept by the wind, and stood\nafter the cutter, whose white canvass we could still see through the gloom like a snow--wreath.\n\nAs soon as she saw us she tacked and stood towards us, and came bowling along gallantly, with\nthe water roaring and flashing at her bows.  As the vessels neared each other, they both shortened\nsail, and finding that we could not weather her, we steered close under her lee.\n\nAs we crossed on opposite tacks her commander hailed, \"Ho, the brigantine, ahoy!\"\n\n\"Hillo!\" sung out Blackie, as he backed his maintopsail.\n\n\"What schooner is that?\"\n\n\"Ihe Spanish schooner Caridad.\"\n\n\"Whence, and whither bound?\"\n\n\"Carthagena to Porto Rico.\"\n\n\"Heave--to, and send your boat on board.\"\n\n\"We have none that will swim, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well--bring--to, and I will send mine.\"\n\n\"Call away the boarders,\" said our captain, in a low stern tone; \"let them crouch out of sight\nbehind the boat.\"\n\nThe cutter wore, and hove--to under our lee quarter, within pistol shot. We heard the rattle\nof the ropes running through the davit blocks, and the splash of the jolly boat touching the\nwater, then the measured stroke of the oars, as they glanced like silver in the sparkling sea,\nand a voice calling out, \"Give way, my lads.\"\n\nThe character of the vessel we were on board of was now evident; and the bitter reflection\nthat we were chained to the stake on board of a pirate, on the eve of a fierce contest with\none of our own cruisers, was aggravated by the consideration that the cutter had fallen into\na snare, by which a whole boat's crew would be sacrificed before a shot was fired.\n\nI watched my opportunity as she pulled up alongside, and called out, leaning well over the\nnettings, \"Get back to your ship! treachery! get back to your ship!\"\n\nThe little French serpent was at my side with the speed of thought, his long clear knife glancing\nin one hand, while the fingers of the other were laid on his lips.  He could not have said\nmore plainly, \"Hold your tongue or I'll cut your throat;\" but Sneezer now startled him by rushing\nbetween us, and giving a short angry growl.\n\nThe officer in the boat had heard me imperfectly; he rose up--\"I won't go back, my good man,\nuntil I see what you are made of; and as he spoke he sprung on board, but the instant he got\nover the bulwarks he was caught by two strong hands, gagged and thrown bodily down the main\nhatchway.\n\n\"Heave,\" cried a voice, \"and with a will!\" and four cold 32--pound shot were hove at once into\nthe boat alongside, which crashing through her bottom, swamped her in a moment, precipitating\nthe miserable crew into the boiling sea.  Their shrieks still ring in my ears as they clung\nto the oars and some loose planks of the boat.\n\n\"Bring up the officer, and take out the gag,\" said Williamson.\n\nPoor Walcolm, who had been an old messmate of mine, was now dragged to the gangway half--naked,\nhis face bleeding, and heavily ironed, when the blackamoor, clapping a pistol to his head,\nbid him, as he feared instant death, hail \"that the boat had swamped under the counter, and\nto send another.\" The poor fellow, who appeared stunned and confused, did so, but without seeming\nto know what he said.\n\n\"Good God,\" said Mr Splinter, \"don't you mean to pick up the boat's crew?\"\n\nThe blood curdled to my heart as the black savage answered in a voice of thunder, \"Let them\ndrown and be d--d! fill, and stand on!\"\n\nBut the clouds by this time broke away, and the mild moon shone clear and bright once more,\nupon this scene of most atrocious villainy.  By her light the cutter's people could see that\nthere was no one struggling in the water now, and that the people must either have been saved,\nor were past all earthly aid; but the infamous deception was not entirely at an end.\n\nThe captain of the cutter, seeing we were making sail, did the same, and after having shot\nahead of us, hailed once more.\n\n\"Mr Walcolm, why don't you run to leeward, and heave--to, sir?\"\n\n\"Answer him instantly, and hail again for another boat,\" said the sable fiend, and cocked his\npistol.\n\nThe click went to my heart.  The young midshipman turned his pale mild countenance, laced with\nhis blood, upwards towards the moon and stars, as one who had looked his last look on earth;\nthe large tears were flowing down his cheeks, and mingling with the crimson streaks, and a\nflood of silver light fell on the fine features of the poor boy, as he said firmly, \"Never.\"\nThe miscreant fired, and he fell dead.\n\n\"Up with the helm, and wear across her stern.\" The order was obeyed. \"Fire!\" The whole broadside\nwas poured in, and we could hear the shot rattle and tear along the cutter's deck, and the\nshrieks and groans of the wounded, while the white splinters glanced away in all directions.\"\"\"\n\nresult = detect_plagiarism(input_text)\nprint(f'Text: \"{input_text[:50]}...\" - Result: {result}') ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-29T09:23:07.147817Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-29T09:23:07.148203Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-29T09:23:07.321618Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-29T09:23:07.148165Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-29T09:23:07.320696Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Text: \"But how different from the clean steams and beauti...\" - Result: Not Plagiarized\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
